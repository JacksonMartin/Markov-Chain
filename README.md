# Markov-Chain
This is a simple program that can load one or multiple text files and use them to create a simple markov chain that generates more text. 

Length is the length of the outputted text in characters.  
Order is the number of characters looked at to generate new text (so if you had order three, and it had written "Hello", it would base its next character based on "llo".  

To load text files, click add below the box on the right half of the window, and navigate to the file.  All files added will be combined and treated as one, so select a file and remove it if you don't want it to be included.  If Save as File is selected, they will be saved in the same location as the program.
