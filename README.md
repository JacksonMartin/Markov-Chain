# Markov-Chain
This is a simple program that can load one or multiple text files and use them to create a simple markov chain that generates more text. 

Length is the length of the outputted text in characters.  
Order is the number of characters looked at to generate new text (so if you had order three, and it had written "Hello", it would base its next character based on "llo".  
In order to load a file, click file, and then open.
